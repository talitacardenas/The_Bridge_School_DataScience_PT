About TeLlevoTeLlevo is a mobility startup that lets any user to book a ride to from any point A to any point B within the city using a smartphone. Ride value is calculated at the time of request automatically by the app, considering distance, estimated travel time, and current car availability (demand /offer balance). Once the ride ends, we charge passenger's credit card, and transfer 75% of this value to the driver's bank account. Finally, before the passengers gets picked up, the ride can be cancelled by either the driver or the passenger.
